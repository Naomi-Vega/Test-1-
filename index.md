My name is Naomi, I'm a 24 year old girl from Mexico City :mexico:

My hobbies are drawing, reading and playing the piano from time to time. Also I enjoy listening to new music of any genres (favorite genres would be pop and rock). 

I arrived Vancouver a month ago looking to improve my english skills and get new experience on programming since back in Mexico I took some small courses and worked for the Google Cloud company which allowed me to have a few background on the website development environment :space_invader:

I chose this country because of the weather and the friendly community you can find here. It was my first time seeing snow too so I was really excited to see what other new experiences I could have in Vancouver. 

This is a brief presentation of myself, **glad to meet you!**
